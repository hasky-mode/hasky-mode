*No, you probably don't want to use this right now. But yes, it'll be a
lightweight no-nonsense mode for Haskell. Together with indentation and the
`hasky-stack` package which soon will support GHCi sessions, it'll be
powerful enough for me to abandon `haskell-mode` completely.*

A major mode for Haskell providing syntax highlighting.

## Installation

Download this package and place it somewhere, so Emacs can see it. Then put
`(require 'hasky-stack)` into your configuration file. Done!

TODO Add MELPA instructions here when it's in MELPA.
